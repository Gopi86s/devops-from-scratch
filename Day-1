# 🚀 What is DevOps?

Before diving into the definition of DevOps, let’s go back to the basics and understand how the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** evolved over time.

## 📌 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Every business that builds software follows some basic steps to deliver a working product. But since customers usually don’t understand technical terms, we need a **Business Analyst (BA)** — someone who acts as a bridge between the customer and the developers.

The Business Analyst helps gather business needs and converts them into understandable tasks for the tech team.

### 🔁 SDLC Key Stages:

1. Requirements gathering  
2. Planning and designing  
3. Implementation (coding)  
4. Deployment  
5. Testing  
6. Release to the public  
7. Maintenance after go-live

## 💧 Waterfall Model

Let’s use a **school analogy** to make it simple.

### 🏫 School Analogy

Imagine a traditional school system. The stakeholders are:

> Teachers, Students, Parents, Principal, Investors, Management, and the Government.

In the old days, schools used to have just one **final exam every year**. Because of that:

- Students wouldn’t study until the exam was near  
- Teachers delayed completing the syllabus  
- Parents worried about performance from Day 1  

🎯 **Result**: Very low pass percentage — only about **30% students passed**, and **70% failed**, repeating the same class next year.

As a result, schools started worrying about their reputation, performance, and students leaving. They introduced a better model...

---

## 🔁 Agile Model

Schools began **monthly tests**, **quarterly exams**, **semi-finals**, and **finals**.

✅ Students started preparing regularly  
✅ Teachers completed the syllabus on time  
✅ Performance pressure helped students stay focused  

### 📈 Progress Chart:

- First month: Pass percentage = 35%  
- Second month: Increased to 45%  
- End of year: Reached around 70%  

This model ensured **consistent progress** and **measurable improvement**.

---

## ⚡ DevOps Model

Then schools went even further...

They introduced **daily assessments**, **weekly tests**, **monthly reviews**, and **final exams**.

🎯 **The result?**  
Massive improvement — **95%+ pass percentage** 🎉

## 🧑‍💻 Now Let’s Apply the Same to Software Industry

### 💧 Waterfall Model (in Software)

In the early days, software teams followed the **Waterfall model**.

- Client gives full requirements upfront and a **1-year deadline**
- Developers think: _“We have time”_ and delay coding
- After 6 months, they start writing code
- Development takes 3 months
- Testing team gets the code with only 2 months left
- They find 10 defects
- Developer says: _“I wrote this 3 months ago! I forgot the logic!”_

😡 Blame game begins:

- Developers blame testers  
- Testers blame developers  

💥 **Client expected a Ferrari, but got an Alto 800.**

Clearly, something had to change...

---

## 🔁 Agile Model (in Software)

Companies started caring more about clients and adopted **Agile**, using **sprints**.

### 🧩 Example Modules:

- Signup & Login  
- Product Management  
- Order Management  
- Shipping  
- Payments  
- Reviews  

### 🚀 Sprint-1: (2 weeks to 1 month)

- Client: “I need the **Signup & Login** module this month.”
- Developer takes 15 days to code it
- During that time, testers wait (idle)
- Once ready, code goes to testers
- Testers take a week → Find 2 bugs
- Developer fixes them

✅ Module is ready by month-end.

🔄 If the client suggests changes, they go to the **Sprint-2 backlog** — along with the next module (e.g., Product Management).

📌 **Client expected a Ferrari, got a Honda City** — decent and delivered.

---

## ⚡ DevOps Model (Modern Need)

With cheaper internet and massive user growth, **traffic increased**. Apps and websites started to struggle:

- Server crashes  
- Delayed releases  
- Poor performance  

That's when **DevOps** stepped in to solve **real-world** problems.

---

## 💡 So... What is DevOps?

> **DevOps** is the process of **developing, building, deploying, and testing on the same day** — which improves coordination between development and operations teams.  
>  
> We use multiple tools in the DevOps process to achieve this — for example:  
> **Configuration Management**, **CI/CD pipelines**, **Monitoring**, and **Automation**.

---

## 🔄 Daily DevOps Cycle

1. Developer writes code today  
2. Code is **immediately** sent to testing  
3. Testing is done **same day**  
4. Bugs are fixed quickly  
5. Code is deployed to **DEV/Staging**  
6. If all good → deployed to **production**

### 📅 Example – Day 1 Task:

> **Feature**: Signup Form  
> **Fields**: First Name, Last Name  
>  
> Testing team finds **2 defects**  
> - 1 valid  
> - 1 invalid  
>  
> Developer fixes the valid one ✅  
> Code is deployed the **same day**

## 🛠️ DevOps Helps You:

- Deliver updates **faster**
- Reduce **errors and bugs**
- **Scale** effortlessly
- **Break silos** between teams
- **Improve customer satisfaction**

| Model      | Feedback Cycle      | Delivery Speed | Team Coordination | Output Quality |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Waterfall  | At the end           | Slow           | Poor              | Low            |
| Agile      | Sprint-based         | Moderate       | Moderate          | Good           |
| DevOps     | Daily & Continuous   | Fast           | Excellent         | High           |
